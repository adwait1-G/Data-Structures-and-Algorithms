1. Arrays
2. Single Linked lists.
3. Doubly Linked Lists - XOR
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Circular Queue
7. Trees
8. Binary Tree
9. Binary  Search Tree
10. AVL Tree
11. Heap

13. Graph



Plan: 

1. Get ready with all the basic Data Structures and solve all the problems related to them . Check out this link and solve every single problem in this: 

Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/#AdvancedDataStructure

2. Simultaneously, Take part in codeforces contests and will solve atleast 2 problems in every contests.

3. After Data Structures are done, I will move on to Types of Algorithms. Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming and Greedy. Will start with Dynamic Programming first.

By the time I complete all this, I would have got some grip over the whole scene!
